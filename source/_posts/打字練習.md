## 死亡鬼屋
小時後在百貨公司的遊樂場? 有個叫做[死亡鬼屋](https://store.steampowered.com/app/246580/The_Typing_of_The_Dead_Overkill/)的遊戲 , 沒想到這個還有打字版 XD
不過我看 steam 上面的的好像是 2013 年出的版本 , 但是還是買來玩看看 , 讓討厭的英打變得有趣
如果 win10 閃退 or 黑頻可以參考[這個](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPWCTPUziO8)
`win` => `設定` => `顯示器` => `圖形設定圖形` => `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Typing of the Dead Overkill\HOTD_NG.exe` => `省電`

另外有個特色就是可以下載字典 , 這裡列兩個 `1000 most-common words` , `C# Developer` (這個簡直自虐) , 其他語言應該也都有 XD
最後想要自訂字典[可以參考這裡](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=414808565)
因為預設只會顯示遊戲 , 滿不好找的 , 這邊順便列一下 , 不過實在懶得自己動手做 , 還是用別人的就好
英文: `LIBRARY` => `Search Bar` => `TOOLS` => `The Typing of the Dead: Workshop Tool` => `Install`
中文: `收藏庫` => `搜尋條` => `工具` => `The Typing of the Dead: Workshop Tool` => `安裝`
後來我實際製作看看好像有 bug , 不曉得為啥狂跳這句 `There are other files and folders in the same folder as the dictionary file. Please remove them and leave the dictionary file on its own in the folder.`
後來解法 `Dictionary Name` 那欄不要填欄 , 然後 `Description` 先故意不寫 , 按 `publish` 以後 , 他會跳個視窗 , 這時候寫 `Descirption` 後 , 接著點 `publish` 才會成功 , 想刪除的話 , 也要從 steam 上面刪 , 有夠麻煩 ...
順帶一提他這個工具是 c# 開發的 , 路徑在 `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Typing of the Dead Workshop Tool\TotDO Tools.exe` , 所以可以 decompile 看看


## ttyper
不想花錢又想練習的話也可以參考這個 project [ttyper](https://github.com/max-niederman/ttyper) 簡單樸實的練習方式! 而且是用 rust 開發的整個很潮
```
cargo install ttyper
```

通常有這種 typing game 最想要就是可以自訂練習單字 , 它的位置在 `C:\Users\yourname\AppData\Roaming\ttyper\language` 只要純文字即可
我這裡弄個 400 單來練看看 , 另外實測起來也是可以練中文
